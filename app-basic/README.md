# ComboKeyBasic
ComboKey

I have developed this Android keyboard after realizing that 
typing on the small buttons of the standard virtual keyboard
is not easy because trying to hit correct keys with big thumbs
is really frustrating. 

As a great starting point for this ComboKey application, I had 
a working framework of classes and other files developed by 
metapropos who introduced me to Android programming by creating,
in no time, the GKOS Keyboard application, a virtual implementation
of my GKOS specification. ComboKey uses many of the ideas of GKOS
but has been created for touch screens. GKOS was originally a 
physical device. 

Being not a professional programmer, I hope to get help from 
GitHub developers to improve the code of ComboKey Basic to make
it a proper application for all interested.
